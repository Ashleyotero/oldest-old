    <h1> Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
    <h4 class="indent"><strong>Why do I need a website?</strong></h4>
    <p class="padding">The internet is the easiest way to reach thousands of potential customers, even outside of your business hours. Potential clients can gather information from your website about your services and contact you directly, bringing the business to you. Customer service is only an email away, and the use of a website can save you money over traditional print advertising.</p>
    <h4 class="indent"><strong>How long is the process?</strong></h4>
    <p class="padding">The process of creating a website from inception to finish varies greatly. Your involvement as the client is essential, and I present your project to you at every stage for your approval. A small website (5-10 pages) can be completed from graphic mock-up stage to a live website in under a month, where larger pages requiring custom programming can take under three months. The speed at which I work largely depends on how quickly I receive your feedback.</p>
    <h4 class="indent"><strong>Can you take over my existing site?</strong></h4>
    <p class="padding">I will take over existing sites only if you are the sole owner of all intellectual property contained in the site, or if you have written approval from other owners. I do ask that you provide me with the working files and/or FTP access to your current site. An initial meeting is required for this process.</p>
    <h4 class="indent"><strong>Will you write content for my site?</strong></h4>
    <p class="padding">I can collaborate with you for content for your site. I do ask that you provide me with some keywords you believe describe your site so I may optimize your site for search engines.</p>
