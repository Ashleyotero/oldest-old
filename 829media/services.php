        <h3>Programming</h3>
        <p>I can help you design, build, and maintain your databases. I will provide services for database management to make for dynamic web-services to provide you with the most relevant content. I can offer dynamic control panels that will assist you in keeping on top of the content management and maintenance for your site. My friends at Ohana Design can upgrade you to more powerful scripting and the latest interfaces for your control panel.</p>
        <p><br />
        </p>
        <h3>Web Development</h3>
        <p>I can assist you every step of the way from designing the layout of your site and organizing content, to putting it on the web and cheering when it goes live for the very first time. I offer clean scripting, coding, and design that adheres to W3C compliancy. I can also optimize your current site or existing sites for better search engine accuracy. The user interface design of a site is critical and this is my priority.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I also set up your domain name and hosting, if you do not already have them. I test every site in multiple browsers (IE, Firefox, Safari) and platforms (Mac OS X, Windows XP, and Linux) to assure uniform quality. I can also maintain your site, or teach you how to, if you are not looking to purchase a customized control panel for your site.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Please Note:<br />
          All sites are hosted on my server until the site is completely paid for and you have signed off that the site is as agreed to and fully functional. I will not post it until you are satisfied!</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>Creative Branding</h3>
        <p>I can assist you with the graphical elements of your entire site, as well as advertising around the internet. I can also create your site using any existing media (such as business cards) that you might already have. </p>
