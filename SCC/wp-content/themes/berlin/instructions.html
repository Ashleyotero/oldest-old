			<h3>Best Practices</h3>
				<p>If you want to make changes to how this theme looks and feels, than create a child theme.  Never make changes to the original theme files.  Why?  Because when a new version of this theme is released, all of your changes will be lost when you update.  Plus, making a child theme is incredibly easy.  <a href="http://op111.net/p53">Here is how you do it.</a></p>

			<h3>Installation</h3>
					<ol>

			<h3>Initial setup</h3>
			<p>Berlin is a 950px wide, two column theme.  We need to set up your default image and thumbnail sizes to allow for easy posting and consistent design structure.  Click <strong>Settings - Media</strong> and <strong>set your thumbnail size</strong> to <strong>150px wide by 150px tall</strong>. Set your <strong>medium size</strong> images to <strong>590px wide.  Do not set a height</strong>.  Set your <strong>large size</strong> images to <strong>950px wide.  Do not set a height</strong>.  Post thumbnails are generated automatically by the functions contained in this theme.  This theme uses the new Post Thumbnail feature available in WordPress 2.9.  Read more about this new feature <a href="http://justintadlock.com/archives/2009/11/16/everything-you-need-to-know-about-wordpress-2-9s-post-image-feature" title="WordPress 2.9's post image feature">here</a>.

		<li class="box">
			<h3>Thumbnails</h3>
			<p>By default, thumbnails are auto cropped by Wordpress.  You can override these crops in WordPress 2.9.  This is the order in which the theme attempts to grab an image to use as a post thumbnail:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Looks for an image by custom field called "thumbnail".</li>
	<li>If no image is added by custom field, it checks for a <a href="http://justintadlock.com/archives/2009/11/16/everything-you-need-to-know-about-wordpress-2-9s-post-image-feature" title="WordPress 2.9's post image feature">post image</a> (WordPresss 2.9+ feature).</li>
	<li>If no image is found, it grabs the latest image attached to your post using the Add Media icon.</li>
	<li>If no image is attached, it can extract an image from your post content (off by default).</li>
	<li>If no image is found at this point, it will defer to a default image.</li>
</ol>

		</li>
		<li class="box">
			<h3>Homepage category configuration</h3>
			<p>Berlin makes use of custom queries to pull in various posts from categories that you specify in code.  To configure the categories you would like to have appear in each content region on the homepage, open up home.php in a text editor, like TextEdit, Coda, or NotePad, and locate lines 18, 38, 51, 67, & 96.  Change the cat=1 to the specific category ID's of your choosing.  <a href="http://www.wprecipes.com/how-to-find-wordpress-category-id">Here is how you find your category id's.</a></p>
		</li>
		<li class="box">
			<h3>Navigation</h3>
			<p>The navigation contains a link to your homepage, about page, archive page, and RSS feed.  First, visit Settings -> Permalinks and change it to Day & Name.  Second, create a page called "About." Third, create a page called "Archive" and assign it the Page Template "Archive."  You can add or remove links be opening header.php and changing lines 54-58.
		</li>
		<li class="box">
			<h3>Widgets</h3>
					<p>There are a total of three widgetized areas on this theme, depending on which options you activate on the Theme Options panel.  Three widgetized areas appear on the bottom and there is one sidebar widget. You can add and delete widgets by clicking Design - Widgets, from within your Wordpress admin panel.</p>
		</li>
		<li class="box">
			<h3>Advertising</h3>
			<p>This theme has a built-in spot for advertising on the homepage.  You can add your adversing code by editing line 85 on home.php.  You can also add more advertisements using Widgets.</p>

			<h3>Common problems</h3>
			<p>This theme uses jQuery javascript to do lots of fancy stuff.  If your theme looks broken, than you likely have a plugin that uses a conflicting javascript library.  Deactivate your plugins, one-by-one, to determine which plugin is conflicting with jQuery.</p>

			<h3>Recommended plugins</h3>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/fancybox-for-wordpress/">Fancybox</a>: The best lightbox plugin available, currently seen on Apple.com.</li>
				<li><a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-super-cache/">WP Super Cache:</a> This plugin generates static html files from your dynamic WordPress blog.  After a html file is generated your webserver will serve that file instead of processing the comparatively heavier and more expensive WordPress PHP scripts.</li>
