<p><strong>Madam Coco DiVine</strong> has a background in Public Relations and a history on stage. Performing in many theatrical and musical numbers. A women studies scholar with a strong feminist approach to life she sees The Desert Dolls as a way to encourage pride, confidence, and healthy sexuality to all who partake. " My goal is to show the people of Southern New Mexico that there is more then one kind of beautiful, while providing a fun, safe, and sexy place for women to express themselves, face and tackle body issues, and find an inner power as a female." She wants to encourage all who are interested and want to learn more to please </p>
<p><strong>Mimi Martini</strong> (Ashley Richards).  She enjoys dungeons & dragons, final fantasy games, and stupid men.  Oh wait, not that last part. </p>
<p>Introducing <strong>“Luna de Miel”</strong> (aka Valerie Beltran): Luna, a burlesque neophyte, is hoping that her experience with this tantalizing artform will prepare her for her upcoming wedding…wedding night, that is. Watch as Luna discovers her sexuality and learns to be comfortable with the more sensual, taboo side of herself. True to form, this ‘blushing bride’ is the shy one of the group, but perhaps after a few shows, she’ll reveal more than she ever thought imaginable. </p>
<p>Introducing <strong>"Carmela L'douche"</strong>! Carmela (Felicia Gonzalez) is new to burlesque but has always admired classic beauties such as Sophia Loren, Rita Hayworth and her favorite beauty and inspiration, Lucille Ball. She loves classic jazz and has an extensive music background. Carmela is not new to the stage but is new to comedy and is hoping to bring a few good laughs with her playful, comedic performances. She'll do anything for a laugh, and loves to find humor in everything. Carmela's goal is to bring a sexy, funny twist to burlesque and to encourage women of all shapes and sizes to say, be, and do what they want! She finds beauty in everything, lives life to the absolute fullest and stays as positive as Michelle Duggar's pregnancy test. "I am not funny. What I am is brave"-Lucille Ball</p>
<p><strong>“Miss Jezzebel”</strong> (Imelda Chacon) is more than just a pretty face, she is sensual, funny, irreverent and multitalented, Jezzebel flirts with the edgy, exotic and erotic fringes of burlesque. Evoking the elegant tease and playful naughtiness inspired by her idols Dita Von Teese, Dirty Martini, and Immodesty Blaize.<br />For the last ten years, this "nouveau burlesque" entertainer has titillated crowds across the Southwest with her gypsy belly dance style.  With a strong dance and theater background and extensive experience as a belly dancer, a melodrama actress, and artist, Jezzebel brings sensuality, creativeness, history, and humor to her carefully crafted routines. Jezzebel is known for her creative and hilarious surprises, erotic dance skills, detailed and authentic Middle eastern and early 1900’s costuming. Her interests are dancing, acting, singing, pin up retro glamour, Art, traveling, and New Age… but above all things Glamour & fashion.. It’s her lifestyle.
